Home For The Holidays.
I am a bit hoarse.
The sun is hot.
I will have hot tea.
My favourite hobby is playing soccer.
One of my hobbies is writing letters to my pen-friends.
When we are on holidays I like walking in the mountains.
When it's not so hot, I go rollerskating.
I painted my house gray.
I bought a new house two years ago.
I hope you will like it in our house.

That’s enough!
Many thanks.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Thank you.
Thank God!
I'm fine, thanks.
There is a fixed price for these goods.
That's a pretty animal.
Thank your grandparents.
No, thank you.
Fine, thank you.
Thank you for the pleasant evening.
Have a nice Thanksgiving.
They have 11 children.
They played so well.
What are these charges for?
Thank you very much!
There were 150 people at the wedding.
I paid less than you.
Now and then I do babysitting.
Who is that man?
I already said that.
What does that mean?
That is a lot!
There is no sign for that you have to fingerspell it.
Can you wait there?
Are there any witnesses?
Are there sleeping cars?
Take me there, please.
Is there a restauratnt car on the train?
They have to draw some blood.
My brother is younger than I.
I am majoring in Theater.
Why do you say that?
I did not order that.
Is that enough for you?
I will take that tie.
It is fine like that.
I think there is a mistake in the bill.
Thank you for dining with us.
